## Getting Started

This guide will provide you with the necessary steps to set up and familiarize yourself with the Astro project on your local development machine.

### Installation

Start by installing the project dependencies. Open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and execute:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

### Development Commands

With dependencies installed, you can utilize the following npm scripts to manage your project's development lifecycle:

- `npm run dev`: Starts a local development server with hot reloading enabled.
- `npm run preview`: Serves your build output locally for preview before deployment.
- `npm run build`: Bundles your site into static files for production.

For detailed help with Astro CLI commands, visit [Astro's documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/).

## Deployment

### Building Your Site

Before deployment, you need to create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```



```

Modify the content within these arrays to reflect your data.

### Props in Component Instances

You can pass values to props directly in the page files for components used across pages. Here's an example of a `HeroSection` and `ClientsSection` component with inline props:

```html
<HeroSection
  subTitle="Top-quality hardware tools and expert construction services for every project need."
  primaryBtn="Start Exploring"
  primaryBtnURL="/explore"
/>

<ClientsSection
  title="Trusted by Industry Leaders"
  subTitle="Experience the reliability chosen by industry giants."
/>
```

Edit the props such as `title`, `subTitle`, `primaryBtn`, etc., to personalize these sections. Ensure that you maintain the structure and data types of the props.


### Tailwind CSS

Styling across our project leverages the utility-first classes offered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This methodology allows us to create custom layouts and components with speed and efficiency.

To ensure consistent code formatting, particularly for class sorting, we have integrated the `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` [plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss). The following configuration is set in the `.prettierrc` file at the root of the project:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"]
}
```

### Deployment and Security

We deploy our project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), capitalizing on their robust platform for seamless CI/CD workflows. Using `vercel.json`, we set stringent security headers and caching policies, ensuring adherence to security and performance best practices:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
          "value": "default-src 'self'; [other-directives]"
        },
        "Additional security headers..."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
